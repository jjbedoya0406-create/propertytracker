# Google Cloud setup (one-time, per deployment)

This app is a backend-less SPA: it calls the Google Sheets and Drive APIs directly
from the browser using an OAuth access token issued by Google Identity Services (GIS).
There is no server-side client secret — only a public OAuth **Client ID** is needed.

You (the project owner) do this once per environment (once for local dev, once for
the deployed GitHub Pages site). Each user just signs in with their own Google account
afterward — no per-user setup.

## 1. Create a Google Cloud project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project (e.g. "Property Expense Tracker").

## 2. Enable the required APIs

In **APIs & Services → Library**, enable:

- **Google Sheets API**
- **Google Drive API**

## 3. Configure the OAuth consent screen

In **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**:

- User type: **External** (since this isn't a Google Workspace org app).
- App name, support email: whatever you like.
- Scopes: add
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` (not full `drive` — this scope
    only grants access to files the app itself creates, which is enough for the
    per-user spreadsheet + receipt images and keeps the requested permission
    narrow).
- Test users: add your Google account and your mom's, since the app won't be
  verified by Google (only 2 users, no public distribution — verification is
  unnecessary overhead here).

## 4. Create an OAuth Client ID

In **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**:

- Application type: **Web application**.
- Authorized JavaScript origins — add both:
  - `http://localhost:5173` (local dev)
  - `https://jjbedoya0406-create.github.io` (production — note: just the
    origin, no path; the app itself lives at the `/propertytracker/` path
    under that origin, but GIS only checks the origin)
- No redirect URIs are needed for the token-client flow this app uses.

Copy the generated **Client ID** (looks like `xxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com`).

## 5. Enable the Google Picker API (for "Connect a portfolio")

Used by issue #3: `drive.file` scope only grants access to a file the
signed-in account either created itself, or explicitly selected through
the Google Picker — plain Drive UI sharing (adding someone as an Editor)
isn't enough on its own. Connecting to another account's portfolio uses
the Picker to bridge that gap, which needs its own API key, separate
from the OAuth Client ID above:

1. **APIs & Services → Library**: enable the **Google Picker API**.
2. **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → API key.**
3. Restrict the key (click into it after creating): under **API
   restrictions**, limit it to just "Google Picker API"; under
   **Application restrictions → Website restrictions**, add
   `http://localhost:5173/*` and
   `https://jjbedoya0406-create.github.io/*` — an unrestricted key is
   usable from anywhere by anyone who finds it.

## 6. Set the environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root (already gitignored):

```
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
VITE_GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

For the deployed GitHub Pages build, both values are injected at build time via
GitHub Actions secrets — never commit them directly. In the GitHub repo, go to
**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret** and add
`VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `VITE_GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY` with the same values. The
workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` reads them from there on every build.

Also enable Pages itself: **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions** (not
"Deploy from a branch" — the workflow publishes directly via the Pages API).

## Why `drive.file` and not `drive`

`drive.file` is a narrower OAuth scope: it only lets the app see/manage files it
created itself, not your entire Drive. Since every receipt image is uploaded by
this app, that's sufficient — and it's a much smaller ask than full Drive access,
which matters for the OAuth consent screen review a user sees when signing in.
